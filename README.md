# Predicting Major League Baseball (MLB) Hall of Famers

Predict whether or not an eligible player will ever get voted into the Hall of Fames using their career statistics. This project focuses on predictions for infielders and outfielders only, as pitchers and catchers are evaluated on a different basis and thus would require different data treatments.

## Project Deliverables

The grader or other viewer may find my applicable project deliverables at:

* index.ipynb -- Code for the project, in iPython NoteBook (.ipynb) format. This repo can be downloaded and run on a local server.  
* data/\*.csv -- Data sets downloaded from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ for this project.

## Installation

* Clone this repo to your computer or local server.
* Navigate to the folder using `cd hof-prediction` in the terminal/shell.
